      <h2 id="volando">Why the name Volando</h2>
      <p>
        Volando means "flying" in Spanish. Olena thought about the concept and purpose of the project - to help people find a perfect destination where they could get go and have some time off from their responsibilities and routine, somewhere they could have a rest and indulge in their hobbies. When she was thinking about it, the song Volare started playing inside her head. That song is about a happy person who's flying up in the skies, without a worry in the world. That feeling was something we'd want people to have when they plan their vacations. "Volare" evolved into "volando", that's how the name came about.
      </p>
      <h2 id="balloon">Why there's a hot-air balloon in the logo?</h2>
      <p>
        The site will help people find a place to live an adventure. The name means flying, so we wanted a logo that would reflect the adventure. An image of a plane symbolizes just travelling, but a hot-air balloon does adds that adventious part, so it's the balloon.
      </p>
      <h2 id="purpose">What's the purpose of the site?</h2>
      <p>
        The site will help people who want to combine their vacation with their hobbies. They don't want to just go somewhere and take a city tour. They want to do what they like in a new exciting place. For example they want to go rock-climbin in Norway. Or they want to go kayaking in Brazil. Or they want to fly on a hotair balloon in Turkey. Volando will help them match their hobbies with the places that offer those opportunities.
      </p>
      <h2 id="audience">Who is this site for?</h2>
      <p>
        It's for anyone who want to combine travelling with their preferred activities. There are destinations for different budgets, different locations, different types of activities and interests. It's not only about sporty or outdoorsy activities, there are also places for art-lovers or someone who just wants peace and meditation.
